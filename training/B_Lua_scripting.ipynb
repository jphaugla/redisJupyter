    "# Lua scripting\n",
    "\n",
    "Redis has an embedded sandboxed Lua engine that can be invoked for executing user scripts. Scripts, executed by the server, are atomic and have full access to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Lua\n",
    "\n",
    "TL;DR it is a scripting language.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to [https://www.lua.org/about.html](https://www.lua.org/about.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Lua is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, data-driven programming, and data description.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode with a register-based virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Redis Lua Sandbox\n",
    "\n",
    "As of v2.6, Redis embeds a Lua v5.1 engine for running user scripts. The engine is sandboxed, in the sense the it exposes a subset of Lua's full functionality, for security purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The restrictions put by the sandbox are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Only [local](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.4.7) declarations are permitted. Attempting to create global variables, or accessing non existing ones, generates an error. \n",
    "* External libraries can't be used, the `require()` function is disabled\n",
    "* Standard built-in libraries that are included:  `base`, `string`, `table` and [`math`](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#5.6)\n",
    "* Standard builit-in libraries that are disabled: `io`, `os` and `debug`\n",
    "* Additional bundled libraries:\n",
    "  * `bit` - bit manipulation\n",
    "  * `struct` - encode/decode C-like structures\n",
    "  * `cjson` - encode/decode JSON\n",
    "  * `cmsgpack` -encode/decode MessagePack\n",
    "  * `redis` - API to the Redis server\n",
    "* A couple of potentially harmful functions are disabled: [`dofile`](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-dofile) and [`loadfile`](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-dofile)\n",

    "1. **Nil**: can only have the value `nil` (evaluates to `false` in conditions)\n",

    "4. **String**: 8-bit, binary-safe strings\n",
    "5. **Function object**: for functions\n",
    "6. **Userdata object**: used for binding with C (irrelevant in the Redis scripting context)\n",
    "7. **Thread object**: used for implementing coroutines\n",
    "8. **Table object**: an associative array\n",
    "\n",
    "To find out the type of a given expression or variable, use Lua's [`type()`](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#pdf-type) function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Lua table data type\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguably the most useful is the Lua table data type. It is an associative array, that can store key-value pairs much like a Python dictionary or a Redis Hash. The following Lua code declares a local variable and initializes it with an empty table.\n",
    "\n",
    "`local emptyTable = {}`\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an initialized associative array, the following syntax is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "`local associativeArray = { ['key1'] = 'value1', [42] = true }`\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing an element in an associative array is either by using the bracketed notation, i.e. `associativeArray[42]`, or with an object-like dotted canonical form, i.e. `associativeArray.key1`. Setting element in an array to the value `nil` is the equivalent of deleting it. Adding key-value pairs to the arrays is as simple as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`associativeArray['new'] = 'some value'`\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, Lua tables can also double as 1-based indexed arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "`local indexedArray = { 1, 'foo', false }`\n",
    "\n",
    "In which case access is via bracketed index notation, i.e. `indexedArray[1]`. To obtain the current length of an indexed array (i.e. the index of the last element), use `#indexedArray`. To append to the indexed array use the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "`indexedArray[#indexedArray+1] = 'appended value'`\n",
    "\n",
    "or use [`table.insert()`](https://www.lua.org/pil/19.2.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "`table.insert(indexedArray, 'appended value')`\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove an element for the array, call `table.remove()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Script parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Passing parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Some scripts require input parameters when called. With Redis' Lua scripts there's a clear distinction between two types of input:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Key names - the names of **all** keys touched by the script\n",
    "2. Arguments - anything that isn't a key's name\n",

    "* No support for multiple keys in others, e.g. `SADD`\n",

    "But even if these were to be resolved eventually, gaps would always be present because some \"missing\" commands are too specialized to be included in the core. Such commands are no less common, but each is usually tailored to a specific use case of a particular application.\n",

    "\n",
    "As of version 3.2, Redis supports another mode for replicating scripts. Instead of using the script's body, the calls to `redis.call()` can be persisted (in AOF) and/or replicated (to slaves) Redis commands inside a `MULTI/EXEC` transaction. When using this replication mode Redis essentially captures the effect of a script, hence the its name.\n",

    "\n",
    "The other benefit of using effect replication is that it helps avoid repeating time-consuming computations. In some cases, where the script's logic is complex and/or the data is voluminous, execution time can become significant. And while that price has to be paid at least once, script replication dictates that it will be repeated in every AOF recovery and/or slave synchronization. But when a slave is being synchronized, let alone when recovery from persistent storage is carried out, time is the one thing you don't want to waste.\n",
    "\n",
    "To switch from the default, script-based replication to effects replication, a script needs to call the `redis.replicate_commands()` library function before performing any write operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Selective replication of commands\n",
    "\n",
    "Once effects replication is used, it is possible to further control the persistence and replication of commands. This is useful, for example, when temporary data is written while the script is running - resources can be saved by not replicating transient effects, only the final meaningful ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: this functionality is advanced and powerful - it can easily do damage when misused\n",
    "\n",
    "A script can control the replication of effects by calling the `redis.set_repl()` library function. The function accepts a single argument that can be one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `redis.REPL_ALL` - this is the default behavior in which effects are replicated to slaves and AOF\n",
    "* `redis.REPL_AOF` - effects are stored only in AOF\n",

    "* `redis.REPL_NONE` - effects are not replicated\n",

    "* Adhere to explicitly declaring the keys touched by a script by passing them using the `KEYS` table. Specifically:\n",
    "  * Do not use key names that are hardcoded in your script\n",
    "  * Do not use key names that are programmatically generated by the script, e.g. by concatenating values\n",
    "  * Do not use key names that are based on data read from values in the database (in other keys)\n",
    "* Keep your scripts lean and fast - long-running scripts have an impact on performance\n",
    "* Scripts are meant to be stateless, pure functions - the protection against globals is designed to help that. If you have to provide a state to the script, use parameters. If the state must be stored in the database, use a key.\n",
    "* A script can not run another script - `redis.call()` will error on `EVAL` or `EVALSHA`, and there is no documented way to invoke a cached script from the code of another (though an undocumented way is to call `f_theotherscriptssha1sum()`)\n",
