    "# Connecting to Redis\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in working with Redis, like most any database, is setting \n",
    "up a connection to the database server.  The server could be running \n",
    "on the same machine as the application program or on a remote machine\n",
    "dedicated to running the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will walk through establishing a connection to Redis on either a local or\n",
    "remote host, and using that connection to implement your first Redis program. To\n",
    "accomplish these tasks, you will need to learn about:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Redis client libraries\n",
    "* Database connection parameters\n",
    "* Establishing connections to a database\n",
    "\n",
    "After learning the basics of establishing a connection, we will walk through a\n",
    "Redis version of the classic Hello World program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Client Libraries \n",
    "\n",
    "Redis is accessed through a client object that provides methods for executing the Redis\n",
    "commands. This paradigm of exposing a client object is used by most Redis libraries as\n",
    "well as a host of other NoSQL and relational database libraries. This paradigm is popular\n",
    "across a programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular client library for Python is the open source `redis-py` package. The\n",
    "`redis-py` package can be installed on a system using any of the popular Python package\n",
    "management systems. We will be using this library for all of our examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a Redis client with `redis-py` is extremely simple - just instantiate an instance\n",
    "of the `StrictRedis` object. Once constructed, the resulting instance allows you to\n",
    "manipulate data on your Redis server through method calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "* * *\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> For historical reasons, the `redis-py` API provides two client objects \n",
    "> `Redis` and `StrictRedis`.  `StrictRedis` should be used for all new projects.\n",
    "> The `Redis` class is provided for backwards compatibility with older versions\n",
    "> of the library.\n",

    "## Connection Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Connection parameters are used to identify the Redis database your program will be\n",
    "communicating with.  Although that database could be on the same machine as your\n",
    "program or a remote server, the parameters used to specify a connection are always\n",
    "the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four connection parameters used with all Redis clients: `host`, `port`,\n",
    "`password`, and `db`.  Each of the parameters is documented in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Paramter | Meaning | Examples\n",
    "---------|---------|----------\n",
    "host | DNS name of database server | redis-16464.c8.us-east-1-3.ec2.cloud.redislabs.com\n",
    "port | port number of database     | 6379 (default Redis port)\n",
    "password | database password | secret\n",
    "db | virtual database number | 0 (default)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first three parameters: `host`, `port`, and `password` should be familiar to anyone\n",
    "with client-server programming experience.  These parameters are used to identify the \n",
    "network address of a sever process; however, the `db` parameter is unique to Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Redis, your data can be partitioned across multiple *virtual* databases\n",
    "identified by an integer.  When specifying a database connection, the `db` parameter is\n",
    "used to specify which virtual database your connection will be interacting with.  If\n",
    "unspecified the default database is zero. Virtual databases an be used to partition your data \n",
    "within the same process.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* * *\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> While Redis supports multiple virtual databases to separate your data, the use of \n",
    "> multiple databases in production systems is discouraged. The recommended practice for \n",
    "> data separation in Redis is to deploy multiple database processes.  Some systems, \n",
    "> including Redis<sup>e</sup>, have gone as far as dropping support for multiple databases\n",
    "> given how strongly the practice is discouraged.\n",
    ">\n",
    "\n",
    "* * *\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we show how to create a single connection to Redis using the\n",
    "`StrictRedis` object. We specify the parameters for our database connection in a Python\n",
    "dictionary and pass the dictionary to the `StrictRedis` constructor using the `**` syntax\n",
    "to unpack the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor for both the `StrictRedis` and `Redis` objects takes a number of keyword\n",
    "arguments to specify a Redis connection. The `**` syntax conveniently allows us to specify\n",
    "our connection configuration once as a dictionary and then reuse that dictionary structure\n",
    "whenever we need to specify connection parameters.\n",
