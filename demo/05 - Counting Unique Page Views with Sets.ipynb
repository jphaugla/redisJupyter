    "# Counting Unique Page Views with Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Page metrics are an important measurement of the health and vitality of a website. Page\n",
    "view metrics can not only measure customer interest in your site, they can also identify\n",
    "user interface and operational problems in real time. Commonly tracked site metrics\n",
    "include page views, daily active users, unique views, and monthly active users. Redis can\n",
    "be a vital part of your analytics processing pipeline, computing aggregate statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we are going to look at how the Redis set datatype is used to calculate\n",
    "and store unique viewers.  Among the topics we will cover in this chapter:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sets in Redis and Python \n",
    "* Specifying data storage conventions \n",
    "* Using structured keys for data \n",
    "* Adding views \n",
    "* Scanning keys\n",
    "* Secondary indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Redis Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Redis provides two types of set data structures, the set and the sorted set. Either set\n",
    "type would work to calculate unique viewers, but in this chapter we are going to look at\n",
    "examples using the set data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets in Redis are very similar to the set data structure found in many programming\n",
    "languages or mathematics. Redis sets are an unordered collection of unique elements.\n",
    "Elements in Redis are represented as strings and byte-wise equality test is used to\n",
    "determine if two elements are equal. Unlike lists, the sets `(1, 2, 3)`, `(2, 3, 1)`, and\n",
    "`(3, 1, 2)` are all identical as they contain the exact same elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are fifteen different command to manipulate set data in the current release of Redis\n",
    "(3.2). These commands provide a variety of different operations including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adding elements to and removing elements from a set\n",
    "* Testing for elements in the set\n",
    "* Retrieve various elements of a set\n",
    "* Compare and combine multiple sets \n",
    "\n",
    "Redis' set commands generally fall into one of two categories: those that operate on a\n",
    "single set and those that operate on multiple sets. The commands that operate on a\n",
    "individual set normally take a key and a series of one or more elements as parameters. The\n",
    "commands that operate on multiple sets normally take a series of keys as parameters and\n",
    "either return a set as a result or write the result into a destination set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sets in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python language provides a built-in set datatype that is used by Redis client\n",
    "libraries, including **redis-py** the client we are using for our example code, to\n",
    "represent sets returned from a Redis command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets were a later introduction to the Python language. Sets are constructed in Python\n",
    "using the `set([iterable])` constructor. Newer versions of Python, including the one we are\n",
    "using for this Notebook, provide the syntactical shortcut `{item1, item2,...}`. If you are\n",
    "unfamiliar with Python sets, please see the Python documentation on [standard Python\n",
    "types](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#set) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Page Views\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw page views are an important metric for websites, but there are other important metrics\n",
    "based on individual users that require additional resources to compute. Unique daily page\n",
    "views, daily active users (DAUs) and monthly active users (MAUs) are all common metrics\n",
    "for measuring the performance of a website.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we are going to look at how Redis can be used as part of an event based\n",
    "analytics pipeline. In our example, Redis will be used to store information about users,\n",
    "allowing us to compute aggregated statistics for unique users on a daily, weekly, and\n",
    "monthly basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analytics system reads processed data from an event log which could be implemented by\n",
    "a wide range of software, including Redis. Our log system provides a stream of interesting\n",
    "events - logins, page views, downloads - that our analytics pipeline can process into\n",
    "interesting metrics and data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our examples will look at how to process a stream of events into Redis to generate sets of\n",
    "unique users. Then once we have that data loaded into Redis, we show examples of how Redis\n",
    "can be used to compute addition metrics and aggregations from that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Storage Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Our pipeline will store unique pages viewers in a set associated with both the\n",
    "page and the date.  Our system provides us with a unique, integer page id for\n",
    "each page in the system, so we can use that id plus the date to construct a \n",
    "key of the form `page:{page_id}:unique:{year}:{month}:{day}` to reference our unique\n",
    "user set.  The members of the set will be the integer user id associated with each\n",
    "database user.\n",
    "\n",
    "* * *\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The standard date and time handling libraries in programming languages provide \n",
    "> facilities for getting the day, month and year components from a timestamp.\n",
    "> In Python the `time.gmtime` or `time.localtime` functions provide those conversions.\n",
    "> Because we are doing log processing, we will use the `gmtime` function in our examples.\n",
    "> If you are unfamiliar with the time handling functions in Python, please see the \n",
    "> [time package documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html) for more \n",
    "> details.\n",

    "## Recording a Page View\n",
    "\n",
    "In our first example, we are going to read events from our event stream and record the\n",
    "page view events in Redis. Using the Redis set data structure, our stream processing\n",
    "function will generate sets of unique users.\n",
    "\n",
    "As our code processes events in the stream, it will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Parse the event\n",
    "* Compute a key based on the event data\n",
    "* Store the viewer in the viewers set\n",
    "\n",
    "The Redis SADD (**S**et **ADD**) command adds the specified member to a set, creating\n",
    "the set if it doesn't already exist.  Since a member can only exist in the set\n",
    "once, we can add the user to the set every time we record a page view for the\n",
    "user, but the user will only be stored once, giving us our unique user data.\n",
