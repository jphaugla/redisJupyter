    "# RediSearch: a full-text search engine\n",
    "\n",
    "Redisearch implements a search engine on top of Redis. Unlike other Redis search libraries, it does not use internal data structures like Sorted sets, but rather its own data structures via the Redis Modules API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Full-Text indexing of multiple fields in documents.\n",
    "* Incremental indexing without performance loss.\n",
    "* Document ranking (provided manually by the user at index time).\n",
    "* Complex boolean queries with AND, OR, NOT operators between sub-queries.\n",
    "* Optional query clauses.\n",
    "* Prefix based searches.\n",
    "* Field weights.\n",
    "* Exact Phrase Search, Slop (number of words between) based search.\n",
    "* Stemming based query expansion in many languages.\n",
    "* Support for custom functions for query expansion and scoring.\n",
    "* Limiting searches to specific document fields.\n",
    "* Numeric filters and ranges.\n",
    "* Geo filtering using Redis' own Geo-commands.\n",
    "* Supports any utf-8 encoded text.\n",
    "* Retrieve full document content or just ids\n",
    "* Automatically index existing Hash keys as documents.\n",
    "* Document deletion and updating with index garbage collection.\n",
    "* Auto-complete suggestions (with fuzzy prefix suggestions)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Redisearch project website is at [http://redisearch.io](http://redisearch.io).\n",
    "\n",
    "Redisearch is open source, the code is available at [https://github.com/RedisLabsModules/RediSearch](https://github.com/RedisLabsModules/RediSearch).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is searching\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching is a core capability of almost any service and application. In fact, consider the following examples and the part that search plays in them:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A web search engine (e.g. Google)\n",
    "* A shopping website (e.g. Amazon)\n",
    "* A social network (e.g Facebook or Twitter)\n",
    "* A streaming provider (e.g. Netflix)\n",
    "* Your application here\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the term \"search\" to refer to that capability, it should be interpreted as fetching data based on its value(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Searching in Redis\n",
    "\n",
    "Redis is a (mostly) perfect data store, but when it comes to searching the data - i.e. get by value - it offers virtually nothing. Accessing data in Redis is always by (primary) key, so searching for values requires using one of two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Full scan - perform any search by iterating over all the data items\n",
    "2. Indexing - maintain a data structure that supports efficient search\n",
    "\n",
    "A full scan is not an option in the context of low latency data serving as it is a slow and compute-intensive task. Indices, on the other hand, provide a solution that fits real time search requirements in terms of performance, but at the cost of extra storage and operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Redis has no built-in indexing mechanisms, its core data structures can be used for creating and maintaining them. For example, Sets naturally lend themselves to representing 1:N relationships, and Sorted Sets are excellent for doing range queries. There quite a few well-known \"recipes\" that use different data structures and techniques for indexing in Redis - see the [Secondary indexing with Redis](https://redis.io/topics/indexes) documentation page for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because maintaining an index can quickly become complex, there are a lot of 3rd-party open source libraries that abstract the underlying complexities by providing indexing via an object-mapping framework. Notable examples for such mappers are Ruby's [Ohm (Object-hash mapping)](http://ohm.keyvalue.org/) and Python's [ROM (Redis object mapper)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rom).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why RediSearch\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are many existing search solutions, most do not deliver when indexing and querying billions of document in real-time. Existing technologies usually \"suffer\" from being:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Written in Java\n",
    "* Bloated and complex\n",
    "* Design with disk storage in mind\n",
    "\n",
    "Redis, although extremely performant, has no built-in search and implementing your own indices on top of it can become a challenging task as described above. Moreover, the core Redis data structures are not always optimal for every indexing need in terms of time and/or space and more efficient approaches could be implemented to solve such cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "With v4's Modules API, Redis can be extended with modules that add new data structures and commands to the server. RediSearch is an open source Redis module written from scratch to address these: it indexes documents and executes text, numeric ranges, geospatial and autocomplete queries blazing fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Searching\n",
    "\n",
    "Fetching data, referred to as a document, by its value. RediSearch lets you do exactly that.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A document\n",
    "\n",
    "A collection of one or more attribute properties (values). Attributes may be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Numerical, having numbers as properties\n",
    "* Textual, made up of one or more words (terms)\n",
    "* Geographical, coordinates given as a longitude-latitude pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "RediSearch can store documents as Redis Hashes, or use your existing Redis Hashes. It also allows storing an optional arbitrary binary payload with each document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An index\n",
    "\n",
    "An [index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_index) is the core concept of searching - it is a data structure that's designed to allow efficient access to data, at the cost of additional:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Storage resources: for keeping the index's data\n",
    "* Compute resources: for keeping the data in the index up-to-date\n",
    "\n",
    "An index is a mapping between a value and its location in the database, e.g. the primary key in an RDBMS or key name in Redis. RediSearch creates an index for each indexed attribute and uses several types of indices, depending on the properties' types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The documents table\n",
    "\n",
    "While the input documents may be given any arbitrary identifiers, for compression purposes RediSearch maps each document to an internal identifier. RediSearch uses an efficient implementation of a [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) - [triemap](https://github.com/RedisLabs/triemap) - for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An inverted index (Posting List)\n",
    "\n",
    "An [inverted index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) (also referred to as Posting List) is a mapping between terms and their locations in the database (i.e. documents). RediSearch includes a custom data type that implements an inverted index - this is used for indexing textual terms in the documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A range tree\n",
    "\n",
    "A [tree data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_tree) that is used for range searches. RediSearch uses a clever mix of preallocations and linked lists to maintain trees with close-to-optimal depths.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A search engine\n",
    "\n",
    "Software that builds and queries indices. The general flow for building an index is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take a document\n",
    "2. Break it apart to its constituent values\n",
    "3. Map terms/properties to the document using a Posting List\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching, via queries, is getting the documents that are linked to the provided terms. RediSearch is a search engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training prelude\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections in this notebook show how to work with RediSearch's core capabilities. The dataset used in the examples is the complete works of William Shakespeare. The imported dataset is stored in the `will_play_text.csv` semicolon-separated file in the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code><pre>\n",
    "\"86169\";\"Romeo and Juliet\";\"4\";\"2.2.35\";\"JULIET\";\"O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?\"\n",
    "</pre></code>\n",
    "\n",
    "The uncompressed file is 9.9MB and 111,396 lines long. Each record in it is a single line from Shakespear's works.\n",
    "\n",
    "RediSearch can be used via a client that provides a language-specific interface to the module's API, and the project's website has the [full list](http://redisearch.io/#client-libraries). This notebook uses the Python client, [redisearch-py](https://github.com/RedisLabs/redisearch-py), that's installable with:\n",
