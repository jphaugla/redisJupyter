    "# Serving User Recommendations with Sorted Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Personalization is an  important part of growing a successful  website. Personalization can\n",
    "increase user traffic on  your website. Various algorithms exist to  predict what content a\n",
    "user might be  interested in given their  browsing history. Many third  party systems exist\n",
    "to compute  recommendations, but recommendations aren't  useful if they can't  be served to\n",
    "users quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we are going to look at  how the Redis sorted set set datatype can be used\n",
    "to serve up blog recommendations. Among the topics we will cover in this chapter:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sorted sets versus sets\n",
    "* Specifying data storage conventions \n",
    "* Storing recommendations\n",
    "* Viewing Recommendations  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Sorted Set \n",
    "\n",
    "Redis provides two types of set data structures, the set and the sorted set. In the\n",
    "previous chapter we looked at using the Set type to calculate unique views, and in this\n",
    "chapter we are going to look at using the other set type, Sorted Sets, to serve up user\n",
    "recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorted sets in Redis are similar to the basic set data structure, except every element in\n",
    "the set is associated with a floating point value, called the score. Like Redis sets,\n",
    "sorted sets consist of a collection of unique elements but the set is ordered according to\n",
    "two rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Elements with different scores are ordered by score\n",
    "* Elements with same scores are ordered by string comparison on the element\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these two rules, the set is maintained in ascending order with the smallest element\n",
    "at position zero. As of the 3.2 release, Redis provides 21 different commands to operate\n",
    "on sorted sets. These commands allow the user to perform a variety of operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add and remove elements from the set\n",
    "* Retrieve elements of the set based on score or element name\n",
    "* Update element scores\n",
    "* Combine multiple sets\n",
    "* Determine the size of sets\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also hear Redis sorted sets referred to as zsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Blog Post Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we are going to look at building a system for quickly serving blog post\n",
    "recommendations to users of our website. In our system, recommendations will be generated\n",
    "from a variety of data sources that are processed off-line to generate a list of\n",
    "recommendations that will then be loaded into Redis for serving to visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommendation engine will deliver a new set of recommendations for users all at once.\n",
    "The recommendations data will be structured as a `user_id` followed by a list of\n",
    "`(page_id, score)` tuples. A variable number of recommendations is generated for each user.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Storage Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "Our recommended blog posts will be stored in the database using the sorted set datatype.\n",
    "The recommended blog posts for a particular user will be stored under the key \n",
    "`user:{user_id}:recommendations`.  The recommendation data will consist of the `page_id`\n",
    "of the blog post and a score between -1.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 being highly recommended and a\n",
    "-1.0 being not recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the clarity of our examples, the Notebook environment includes several utility \n",
    "functions.  In this chapter, the primary utility functions we use are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `user_recommendation_key` - generates the appropriate key for the user recommendations\n",
    "* `clear_user_recommendations` - removes the recommendations for the given user\n",
    "\n",
    "## Storing Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in building our example recommendation system is building a system to load\n",
    "the data from recommendation backend into Redis. As our code processes data from the\n",
    "backend recommendation system it needs to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Parse the recommendation data\n",
    "* Compute a key from the data\n",
    "* Remove the key if it exists\n",
    "* Store the recommendations in Redis\n",
    "\n",
    "The Redis ZADD command adds the specified member plus score to the sorted set, creating\n",
    "the sorted set if it doesn't exits. In our sample system, an entire batch of\n",
    "recommendations is loaded at once, so we can't just use the ZADD command, otherwise we\n",
    "would never clear the old recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
