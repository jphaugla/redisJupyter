    "# Tracking Viewed Items Using Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Many websites provide users with a historical view of their browsing history. It could be\n",
    "a list of recently viewed items from a product catalog, prior interactions with the\n",
    "customer service team, or even a list of recently viewed blog posts - providing users with\n",
    "historical information is a useful way to help them find items that were of interest in\n",
    "the past. Regardless of the type of item, it's essential that your system can respond to\n",
    "requests for the data as quickly as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will look at at using the Redis list datatype to maintain historically viewed\n",
    "items on a per user basis. Redis makes it very easy to write code to maintain this list as\n",
    "well as provides fast access to the data when requested by the user. Our examples will\n",
    "cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Storing complex data in lists\n",
    "* Specifying data storage conventions\n",
    "* Identifying per-user lists\n",
    "* Adding items to the recently viewed list\n",
    "* Multiple ways of getting items from the list\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the chapter, you should feel comfortable working with lists in Redis\n",
    "and understand how to apply them to a variety of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Redis provides a list data structure which is used to represent ordered sequences of\n",
    "elements.  Like other Redis data structures, every Redis list is associated with a name,\n",
    "called a key, that is used to reference a particular list.  The maximum length of a list is \n",
    "2^32 - 1 elements, allowing for more than 4 billion elements per list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4294967295, more than 4 billion of elements per list)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Redis' terminology, the two ends of a list are referred to as the left and the right.  \n",
    "The left is associated with the first element of the list and the right is associated with \n",
    "the last element of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "* * *\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Redis' terminology for lists varies from some other languages and algorithm\n",
    "> books.  Other sources use the term head where Redis uses left and the term tail \n",
    "> where Redis uses right.\n",
    "\n",
    "* * *\n",
    "\n",
    "The current version of Redis (3.2) provides seventeen different commands for\n",
    "working with List.  Redis provides commands to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Determine the size of a list\n",
    "* Add and remove items to a list\n",
    "* Scan for items in a list\n",
    "* Modify items in a list\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the advantages that Redis provides when working with list data, is that\n",
    "Redis allows you to modify your data on the database server, rather than having to\n",
    "read the data from the database then write modifications back.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Redis list commands operate on the ends of a list or on a range of\n",
    "elements.  Redis provides commands that operate on both the left and right ends\n",
    "of the list, as well as commands that operate on a contiguous range of elements.\n",
    "A few commands offer scanning or searching capabilities based on a binary comparison \n",
    "of elements.  Indexes into a Redis List are zero-based.\n",

    "### Working with JSON in Redis\n",
    "\n",

    "database as serialized strings.\n",

    "The `json` package will provide all the functionality we need to use serialized\n",
    "JSON strings with Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, JSON objects are generally represented using the built in dictionary\n",
    "datatype.  Dictionaries can be marshaled (serialized) into strings using\n",
    "the `json.dumps` function and strings can be unmarshaled (deserialized) into\n",
    "dictionaries using the `json.loads` function.  If you aren't familiar with the\n",

    "being the oldest item.  Each element of the list will be a serialized JSON string and\n",
    "the list will be capped at ten items.  Ten is an arbitrary number based on our \n",
    "hypothetical feature specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the clarity of our code, the Notebook environment includes several\n",
    "utility functions, so you can focus on the Redis programming details.  For this\n",
    "chapter, the main functions you may want to use from the `workshop` package are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `user_history_key` - generates the proper key from a user id\n",
    "* `ViewedItem.to_serialized_json` - generates a serialized JSON string from a\n",
    "ViewedItem\n",
    "* `ViewedItem.from_serialized_json` - creates a ViewedItem object from a\n",
    "serialized JSON string\n",
    "* `clear_user_history` - removes a users history from Redis\n",
    "* `add_history` - preloads a sample history into Redis for a user\n",
    "\n",
    "We also provide a `ViewedItem` class to represent the application's in-memory\n",
    "data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding an Item\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user views an item on our example site, we need to add that item to the\n",
    "recently viewed item list in Redis.  To accomplish this task, our code\n",
    "will need to perform a few operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Construct a `ViewedItem` instance with the proper data\n",
    "* Serialize the `ViewedItem` into a string\n",
    "* Insert the string into the database (checking for duplicates)\n",
    "* Ensure our lists has no more than 10 elements\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be accomplished with a few lines of code and three Redis commands:\n",
    "LREM, LPUSH and LTRIM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LREM (**L**ist **REM**ove) command removes the specified number of copies of\n",
    "an item from a list.  This command is used to remove the viewed item from the\n",
    "list if it is already there.  The LPUSH (**L**eft **PUSH**) prepends an item to\n",
    "the beginning of a Redis List, so we use this command to add our most recently\n",
    "viewed item to the list.  Finally the LTRIM (**L**ist **TRIM**) command trims\n",
