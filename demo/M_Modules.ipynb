    "# Redis Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Redis modules are a new feature in v4, that allows anyone to extend Redis with new commands and data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are Redis modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules are dynamic libraries that the Redis server can load at runtime. A module can consist of any code and make calls to any 3rd-party library. When loaded, a Redis module can register new commands and data structures with the server. These are virtually indistinguishable from the core commands and data structures, both in terms of usage as well as performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Developing a Redis module\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules can be developed by anyone possessing a certain level of coding skills  - the modules API is open and well-documented. Because Redis is written in C, the API can be used from any language that provides C bindings. These include C, C++, Rust and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actual development of a module is outside the scope of this notebook. For more information and resources related developing Redis modules refer to:\n",

    "## Using modules from Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's de facto standard Redis client, [redis-py](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py), does not treat modules and their commands in any special way. In fact, it allows sending any arbitrary command with the [`execute_command()`](https://redis-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#redis.StrictRedis.execute_command) method. For example, although the client offers the `ping()` method, you can invoke `PING` by sending it raw:"
